üëã Hello! I'm a innovative thinker, developer and technologist with a passion for building practical, efficient, and user-focused applications with AI. My work bridges the gap between complex data processing and the creative potential of large language models. I specialize in prompt engineering, building robust AI agents, and developing data pipelines that serve as the foundation for intelligent systems.

Currently, I am a **Research Teaching Specialist III**, where I am applying these skills to help researchers query a long-term medical study.


Below are some of the projects I'm currently focused on.

## üöÄ Current Project

### [RePORTaLiN](https://github.com/solomonsjoseph/RePORTaLiN)
My main project is **RePORTaLiN**, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline designed for scientific researchers. It emphasizes a modular, configuration-first approach to streamline complex data workflows and produce clear, structured outputs (summaries, tables, graphs).

Key features and goals include:

* **Intelligent Data Loading:** An advanced Excel data dictionary loader that splits grids, respects "Ignore Below" markers, resolves duplicate column names, and writes clean `JSONL`.
* **Direct PDF Retrieval:** Works directly with annotated PDFs to preserve form-specific context, avoiding lossy bulk conversions.
* **Modular & Accessible:** Features a Python entry point and modular scripts to simplify integration, customization, and maintenance for researchers.
* **Reproducible HPC Workflows:** Runs within Singularity containers orchestrated by **Slurm** for consistent, reproducible results.
* **Privacy by Design:** Implements robust safeguards, including least-privilege access and provenance tracking.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Interests
- **LLMs & IR**: LLaMA (Hugging Face), RAG, form-aware context retrieval
- **Data**: Excel-based data dictionaries & mappings, JSONL tables, structured provenance
- **Compute**: Slurm, Singularity containers (reproducible HPC jobs)
- **Delivery**: Clear researcher-facing answers (summaries, tables, plots)
- **Principles**: Privacy-by-design, reproducibility, transparency

### ü§ñ My Custom GPTs
Beyond my core research, I build specialized AI agents. This collection demonstrates my expertise in prompt engineering, AI safety, and creating user-centric tools.

| GPT Name | Focus & Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Prompt Master** | My expert assistant for designing, refining, and evaluating system prompts and AI workflows. |
| **CodeAI** | A coding assistant for generation, refactoring, and debugging across multiple languages, with a focus on best practices. |
| **Research Assistant** | A tool to find and summarize recent academic papers from verified sources, streamlining literature reviews. |
| **Humanizer AI** | Rewrites AI-generated text into a more natural, human style while carefully preserving structure and citations. |
| **My Universal Translator** | Translates between any language with high attention to context, register, and idiomatic expressions. |
| **Expert Language Coach** | Teaches any language using a structured, CEFR-style approach with personalized, bite-sized lessons. |
| **Resume Builder Assistant** | Tailors resumes to specific job descriptions, focusing on measurable outcomes and truthful representation. |
| **Legal Advisor and Teacher**| An educational tool for explaining legal concepts and assisting with academic tasks like case briefs (not a substitute for a lawyer). |
| **The Physics Expert**| Explores physics concepts and problems, from classical mechanics to quantum, showing steps and citing sources. |
| **Global Finance Advisor**| Provides educational guidance on personal finance and macroeconomic concepts with a global perspective (not financial advice). |
| **Pschosis** | Offers supportive, educational content on mental health topics and points users toward reputable, professional resources. |
| **LDS Companion**| An assistant for scripture and gospel questions, sourcing exclusively from official ChurchofJesusChrist.org materials. |
