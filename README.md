ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm a developer and technologist with a passion for building practical, efficient, and user-focused applications with AI. My work bridges the gap between complex data processing and the creative potential of large language models. I specialize in prompt engineering, building robust AI agents, and developing data pipelines that serve as the foundation for intelligent systems.

Below are some of the projects I'm currently focused on.

## ðŸš€ Current Project

### [RePORTaLiN](https://github.com/solomonsjoseph/RePORTaLiN)
A **R**etrieval-**A**ugmented **G**eneration (RAG) pipeline designed for scientific researchers. This project emphasizes a modular, configuration-first approach to streamline complex data workflows.

* **Python Entry Point:** Easy for developers and researchers to integrate and run.
* **Modular Scripts:** Simplifies customization and maintenance.
* **Intelligent Data Loading:** Features an advanced Excel data dictionary loader that can split grids, respect "Ignore Below" markers, resolve duplicate column names, and write clean `JSONL` for downstream processing.

## ðŸ¤– My Custom GPTs

I have designed and built a suite of custom GPTs, each with a specific focus, carefully crafted system prompts, and built-in guardrails to ensure safe and effective interactions.

| GPT Name | Focus & Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Prompt Master** | My expert assistant for designing, refining, and evaluating system prompts and AI workflows. |
| **CodeAI** | A coding assistant for generation, refactoring, and debugging across multiple languages, with a focus on best practices. |
| **Research Assistant** | A tool to find and summarize recent academic papers from verified sources, streamlining literature reviews. |
| **Humanizer AI** | Rewrites AI-generated text into a more natural, human style while carefully preserving structure and citations. |
| **My Universal Translator** | Translates between any language with high attention to context, register, and idiomatic expressions. |
| **Expert Language Coach** | Teaches any language using a structured, CEFR-style approach with personalized, bite-sized lessons. |
| **Resume Builder Assistant** | Tailors resumes to specific job descriptions, focusing on measurable outcomes and truthful representation. |
| **Legal Advisor and Teacher**| An educational tool for explaining legal concepts and assisting with academic tasks like case briefs (not a substitute for a lawyer). |
| **The Physics Expert**| Explores physics concepts and problems, from classical mechanics to quantum, showing steps and citing sources. |
| **Global Finance Advisor**| Provides educational guidance on personal finance and macroeconomic concepts with a global perspective (not financial advice). |
